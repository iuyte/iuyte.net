      <description>Who I&amp;rsquo;m a young programmer, roboticist, scientist and linux enthusiast. My main goal is to learn as much as possible about as much as possible. By no measure am I an expert at any one thing, but as I learn more this will hopefully change.
Projects My github is here
Additionally, I love to mess with my raspberry pi and mod it to do various activities, and am a crucial aspect of the 2 robotics teams at my school.</description>
