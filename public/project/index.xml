      <description>Background xkcd XKCD is a webcomic by Randall Munroe. It consists primarily of romance, sarcasm, math, and language, appealing to a lot of nerdy people (and some non-nerds too). I really enjoy it, and felt the need to create a discord bot for it.
Discord Quote from their website as of today:
All-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that&amp;rsquo;s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone.</description>
