# <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Who</span>
I'm a young programmer, roboticist, scientist and linux enthusiast. My main goal
is to learn as much as possible about as much as possible. By no measure am I an
expert at any one thing, but as I learn more this will hopefully change.

## <span style="color: red;">Projects</span>
My github is [here](https://github.com/iuyte)

Additionally, I love to mess with my raspberry pi and mod it to do various
activities, and am a crucial aspect of the 2 robotics teams at my school.

## <span style="color: red;">Leadership</span>
I participate in Student Government, District Task Force, and the District
Technology Committee at the school district I attend.

I have been a part of Boy Scouts of America Troop 709 for a long time, and am
nearing my Eagle rank at a considerably young age.

## <span style="color: red;">Robotics</span>
While most recently primarily a programmer, I work on building when needed,
as well as wiring and game strategy.
