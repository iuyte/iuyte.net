# <span style="color: red;">First</span>
My first post here, after getting [this site](https://iuyte.net/). I'm very
excited for this, although not sure what in particular I might do with this.

## <span style="color: red;">Happy Thanksgiving</span>
I wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving, and hope that all got great deals Black
Friday shopping.
